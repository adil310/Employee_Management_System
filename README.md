Employee details are stored in a text file named employees.txt in the format: Employee ID, Name, Position, Salary. When adding a new employee, the data is appended to the file. When displaying employee details, the program reads the data from the file and prints it. If the file does not exist or is empty, appropriate messages are displayed.
